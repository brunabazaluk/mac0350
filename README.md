### Important:
If you want to run the server or connect to "pgadmin" database you must be using USP's vpn ```vpn.semfio.usp.br```

### Some instructions (almost nothing)

To see it in your browser you should open ``` localhost:8000/home ```

```$ python manage.py inspectdb``` generates models automatically, according to the database you set at ```mysite/settings.py```

The folder ```examples/``` contains examples (oh rly?!) of some of the important files at ```mysite/```, like ```urls.py```, ```models.py```, etc.

Instructions to run the server are described at ```monitores.txt```
